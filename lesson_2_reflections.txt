What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
   It creates a directory named git, which is a hidden directory and it is used to 
   store the meta data related to commit, version and everything.
   We need to go to a specific directory and use git init command.
   
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
   In case of working directory, we have not added to repository, but before adding
   to repository we want to commit with a logivcal end, so to make it possible we 
   first move multimple files to staging area according to logical ending then we 
   commit at a time so that files will be commited at a time with logical ending.
   So it adds logical ends before commit.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?
